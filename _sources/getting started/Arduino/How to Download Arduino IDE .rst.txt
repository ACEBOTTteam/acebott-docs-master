How to Download Arduino IDE 
======================================

Download Arduino Environment
------

You can directly download the latest version from this link: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
When the download is finished, unzip the downloaded file. Be sure to preserve the folder structure. 
Double-click the folder to open it. There should be several files and sub-folders inside.

The Arduino Software (IDE) allows you to write programs and upload them to your board. In the Arduino Software page you will find two options:

1. If you have a reliable Internet connection, you should use the  `online IDE <https://login.arduino.cc/login?state=hKFo2SB0UkdUb0ttTGFIeUtCS0V5X3VvT2NPZVU1NFlqaGVtbqFupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgYnZUd2lOV20xTWNWT29xRVVEdGFabEpoWW91SGt0WkWjY2lk2SBycjZMU09TejU3aDdmdnNIZFJYWFBrWkczRVJvWFRmWg&client=rr6LSOSz57h7fvsHdRXXPkZG3ERoXTfZ&protocol=oauth2&authorizeTimeoutInSeconds=5&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcreate.arduino.cc%2Feditor&logout_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcreate.arduino.cc&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.arduino.cc&scope=openid%20profile%20email&loginCoppa=login-selector&response_type=code&response_mode=query&nonce=TTYucE9BeGVLOGxXM1J0SVl1dmZJa0puLUgwd3FqdU5vYVJMR2ZMV1I1LQ%3D%3D&code_challenge=GOlRttkggm_AD2hbp2NvzEJ_Mim9xiDCYUg3yAv0NXA&code_challenge_method=S256&auth0Client=eyJuYW1lIjoiYXV0aDAtc3BhLWpzIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6IjEuMTIuMSJ9#/sso/login>`_ (Arduino Web Editor). 
It will allow you to save your sketches in the cloud, having them available from any device and backed up. You will always have the most up-to-date version of the IDE without the need to install updates or community generated libraries.

2. If you would rather work offline, you should use the latest version of the  `desktop IDE <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#download>`_.

Reference for Arduino Programming Language
------

Arduino programming language can be divided in three main parts: structure, values (variables and constants), and functions.
